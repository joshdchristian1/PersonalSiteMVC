                            This View was created manually instead of scaffolding it from the Controller Action. This is because it does not have an Action of its own, but is instead passed as an argument to the return View() in the HttpPost version of the Contact Action. We also passed the ContactViewModel object to this View so it can be used to display information from the message for the user's convenience.
